# Promote a desktop release candidate from preview to stable (issue #150).
#
# Contract:
#  - Takes an existing GitHub release (tag), verifies EVERY required platform
#    artifact and its SHA-256 checksum is present, then flips the release to
#    the stable latest: prerelease flag cleared, marked latest.
#  - Never rebuilds, re-signs, retags or re-uploads anything. The exact
#    artifacts and checksums tested on preview become stable.
#  - Promoting an older known-good tag by name is the rollback path.
#  - Fails closed: any missing artifact or checksum mismatch aborts before
#    the release metadata is touched.
