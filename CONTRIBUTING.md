# Contributing to PhantomChat.chat

Thank you for your interest in contributing. PhantomChat.chat is an early-stage
privacy-focused project and every improvement — code, docs, translations,
bug reports, design — is welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** — open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/phantomchat-chat/phantomchat-chat/issues/new/choose)
  with clear reproduction steps, browser info, and what you expected vs what
  happened. **Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues** —
  see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Suggest a feature** — open an issue labelled `enhancement`. Describe the
  use case and the threat model, not just the UI change.
- **Write code** — see "Development workflow" below.
- **Improve documentation** — typos, clarifications, translations of
  user-facing strings, README improvements. Small doc PRs are very welcome
  and reviewed quickly.
- **Test releases** — install the PWA, use it with a friend, report anything
  that surprises you.

## Development workflow

### 1. Fork & clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/phantomchat-chat.git
cd phantomchat-chat
pnpm install
```

### 2. Create a branch

Name it descriptively:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/chat-reactions
git checkout -b fix/relay-reconnect-loop
git checkout -b docs/security-policy
```

Do not commit directly to `main` in your fork if you plan to submit a PR —
a feature branch keeps the history clean and makes review easier.

### 3. Make your changes

- Keep commits focused. One logical change per commit.
- Follow the style rules enforced by ESLint — run `pnpm lint` before
  committing. The project CLAUDE.md documents the non-obvious style choices
  (no space after `if`, ternary operators at end of line, no spaces inside
  braces, etc.).
- Add or update tests when you touch behavior — `pnpm test` for unit tests,
  `pnpm test:phantomchat:quick` for the fast P2P suite.

### 4. Commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) so the
release tool can generate the changelog automatically:

```
feat(chat): add emoji reactions to message bubbles
fix(relay): handle empty NIP-65 relay list gracefully
docs(readme): clarify IPFS gateway usage
build: pin pnpm version in GitHub Actions
style: fix indentation in mesh-manager.ts
test(e2e): add bidirectional media delivery test
chore: update dependencies
```

Types:

- `feat` — new user-facing feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `docs` — documentation only
- `style` — formatting, no code change
- `refactor` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` — adding or fixing tests
- `build` — build system or external dependencies
- `ci` — CI configuration
- `chore` — other maintenance

Add `!` after the type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer when the change is
backwards-incompatible:

```
feat(storage)!: migrate IndexedDB schema to v2

BREAKING CHANGE: users on v0.2.x will need to re-import their identity.
```

### 5. Open a pull request

- Target the `main` branch.
- Fill in the PR description: what the change does, why it's needed, how
  you tested it, and screenshots if UI is affected.
- Link related issues with `Closes #123` in the description.
- Expect a review within a few days. Small PRs are reviewed faster than
  large ones — if you are changing more than a few hundred lines, consider
  splitting.

### 6. Review & merge

- Address review comments by pushing new commits to the same branch — do
  not force-push during active review, it makes re-review harder.
- PRs are merged via **squash and merge** so the `main` history stays
  linear and each merge corresponds to one logical change.
- After merge, delete your branch.

## Style & code conventions

Full details are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). The highlights:

- **Indent:** 2 spaces, no tabs.
- **Quotes:** single quotes, template literals allowed.
- **No space** after `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, `catch` — `if(cond)`,
  not `if (cond)`.
- **No spaces** inside braces or brackets — `{a: 1}` not `{ a: 1 }`.
- **Ternary operators:** `?` and `:` go at the **end** of the line.
- **No `return await`** — return the promise directly.
- **Path aliases:** always use `@components/*`, `@lib/*`, `@helpers/*`,
  etc. Never `../../..` relative imports when an alias exists.
- **No comments** that explain what well-named code already says. Comments
  are for non-obvious *why*, not narration.
- **This is Solid.js, not React** — no `useState`, no JSX event delegation
  assumptions, no React idioms.

## Testing your changes

```bash
pnpm lint                   # ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit            # TypeScript check
pnpm test                   # Vitest unit tests
pnpm test:phantomchat:quick      # Fast P2P suite (~2s)
pnpm test:e2e:all           # Playwright E2E (slow, needs Docker for local relay)
```

Run at least `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm test:phantomchat:quick` before
opening a PR. The full E2E suite runs in CI on every push to `main`.

## Areas that need help

If you're looking for somewhere to start:

- **Tor UI improvements** — circuit dashboard, per-relay latency, toggle.
- **Internationalization** — translating user-facing strings in `src/lang.ts`.
- **Reproducible builds** — making the Vite output deterministic. See
  [docs/TRUST-MINIMIZED-UPDATES.md](docs/TRUST-MINIMIZED-UPDATES.md).
- **Cross-browser testing** — especially Safari / iOS, where the
  SharedWorker and Service Worker behave differently.
- **Accessibility** — keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader
  compatibility.
